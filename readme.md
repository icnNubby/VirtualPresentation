# Virtual Display & Presentation API demo

## virtual display app
- creates virtual display with surface

## presentation app
- draws on virtual display, attached to presentation

## notes:
- touches are not translated with Presentation/VirtualDisplay API (by default), use windows
- you should handle Display callbacks (not in this demo) to achieve stable result
